## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kumarsanjoy/Therap.git

# Navigate to frontend directory
cd Therap/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup
The backend uses a microservices architecture and is containerized using Docker. The project includes multiple services orchestrated through Docker Compose.

1. **Configuration**  
   Edit the environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file located in the root directory with your specific configuration values before running the application.

2. ### Configuration Setup
Before running the application, you need to update the environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file according to your setup:

**Required Configuration Variables:**
```yaml
# Database Configuration
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: your_database_url
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: your_db_username
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: your_db_password

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET: your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRATION: your_jwt_expiration_time

# Application Configuration
FRONTEND_URL: your_frontend_url_to_allow_CORS
GOOGLE_API_KEY: your_google_api_key

# Database Connection Pool Settings (adjust based on your database capacity)
SPRING_DATASOURCE_HIKARI_MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE: 6 (recommended)
SPRING_DATASOURCE_HIKARI_MINIMUM_IDLE: 2 (recommended)
SPRING_DATASOURCE_HIKARI_IDLE_TIMEOUT: 20000 (recommended)

# Server Configuration
SERVER_TOMCAT_THREADS_MAX: 200
```

3. **Start All Services**
```bash
# Navigate to the root directory
cd Therap

# Build and run all services using Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
```
