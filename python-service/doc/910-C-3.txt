Chapter Three
Structure of Matter

Electronic configuration in different energy level of hydrogen.

Have you ever thought what the things around us are made of? What is our
body made of ? Yes, like us, the ancient philosophers also used to think of these
questions, The ancient Greek scholars used to think, there were four basic
elements- soil, water, air and fire. All other things according to them were made
of these four elements. Greek philosopher Democritus was the first to say that all
substances have a unit which is very small and indivisible. He called it the Atom.
This however did not get any recognition as it lacked any scientific proof.
Afier 2500 years John Dalton, the British scientist, gave a theory on atoms in 1803
which was based on data collected from various experiments. He said, every matter of
the universe is made of small, indivisible particles. He honoured the Greek

philosopher by naming these particles Atom. Later on, it was proved that atoms
36 Chemistry

are not indivisible. Any atom can be divided into electrons, protons and
neutrons. This chapter will focus on various models of the atom, fundamental

3.1 Elements and Compounds

Elements

Certainly you have seen gold. silver or iron. No matter how far you divide pure
gold, you will get nothing but gold. The same is applicable in the cases with
silver or iron. When divided. the matter which does not yield anything but itself,
is called element. Besides the above three, nitrogen. oxygen, phosphorus,
carbon, helium, argon, magnesium, sulfur etc. are also elements. So far, a total
of 118 elements have been discovered. Out of them, 98 elements are available in
nature and the rest are made in the laboratory. The second group is known as
artificial elements. Do you know that your body contains as many as 26 different
elements?

Compounds

You have already known that an element yields the element only. If water is
analyzed, we shall find two different elements- hydrogen and oxygen. The same
way, if we analyze writing chalk, we get calcium, carbon and oxygen. The
substances which, if divided, give away two or more elements are called
compounds. In a compound, elements will always exist in the same ratio. For
example, chemical analysis of any water sample collected from any place will
show two hydrogens and one oxygen. That means, the ratio of hydrogen and
oxygen atoms im water is 2:1. The characteristics of compounds are different
from those of elements they are made of. Again, for example, at normal room
temperature, hydrogen and oxygen are gaseous elements but when they make
water, it is a liquid.

3.2 Atoms and Molecules

Atoms are the smallest particles of elements that contain the characteristics of
the elements. For example: Nitrogen atoms contain the characteristic features of
nitrogen while oxygen atoms contain the same of oxygen.

When two or more atoms remain connected with each other in a chemical bond,
itis known as a molecule. You will learn about chemical bonds in detail in
chapter five. Two oxygen atoms (QO) bond te each other to form an oxygen
38 Chemistry

molecule (O,). Again, a carbon atom (C) bonds with two oxygen atoms (O) to
generate a carbon dioxide (CO,) molecule. When more than one atoms of a
specific element bond each other, they produce that element’s molecule, like O,.
When atoms of different elements bond together to produce a molecule, it is
called a molecule of the compound, like CO,,.

3.5 The Fundamental Particles of an Atom

Each atom consists of three stable particles- electrons, protons and neutrons.
These particles are called fundamental particles of atoms. Protons and neutrons
remain in the nucleus at the center of the atom while electrons continue to
move around the nucleus.

Electron: Electron is one of the fundamental particles of atom containing negative
charge. The amount of this charge is -].60x10°' coulombs. It is expressed

through the symbol e. An electron has the mass of 9.11104 g. The relative
charge of electron is taken to be -1 and the mass of electron is 1/1840 of proton
and neutron, That is why, the relative mass of electron is taken as 0.
40 Chemisiry

Proton: Proton is one of the stable particles of an atom containing positive
charge. The charge is +1.60 «10° coulomb. It is expressed by p. The mass of
proton is 1.67 x 10% g. The relative charge of proton is taken as +1 and relative
mass is taken as 1.

The characteristic properties of fundamental particles of atoms are presented in

the following list.

Proton p | #1.60 * Lo“ “coulomb, 1.673 = 10* g +1 1
Neutron n |0 1.675 « 10% g 0 1

Neutron: Neutron is another stable particle of an atom containing no charge.
Neutron prevails in atoms of all elements except hydrogen. Expressed by n, a
neutron has a mass slightly more than a proton. Its relative charge is O and

relative mass is 1.

3.5.1 Atomic Number

Atomic number of an element is determined by the number of protons present in
the nucleus of that element’s atom. Fer example: an atom of Helium (He) has
two protons in its nucleus, so the atomic number of Helium is 2. Again, an
Oxygen atom has eight protons in its nucleus, so the atomic number of Oxygen
is 8 The atomic number denotes an atom.Therefore, the atomic number can
also be called the ID number of an element, If the atomic number is 1, we
understand it is Hydrogen, if the atomic number is 2, we understand itis Helium,
if the atomic number is 9, we understand it is Fluorine. Thus, atomic number is
the permanent identity of an atom. Proten number or atomic number is
expressed by Z. Since all atoms are charge neutral, so they contain the same
number of electrons as is the number of protons in its nucleus.

2025
Structure of Matter 41

3.5.2 Mass Number

The mass number of an atom is denoted by the total number of protons and
neutrons in its nucleus. The mass number is expressed by A. Since the mass
number is the summation of neutrons and protons, we can get the number of
neutrons in an atom by deducing its proton number from the mass number. The
mass number of Sodium (Na) is 23, its proton number is 11; so the number of

neutrons in sodium is (23 - 11) = 12.

The atomic number of an atom is written at the lower left commer of its symbol
while its mass number is written at the upper left corner. In the case with Sodium
(Na), it will be written as

3.6 Atomic Model

3.6.1 Rutherford’s Atomic Model
Rutherford has given a model on the structure of atom in 1911, The model

slates:

a. In the centre of an atom there is a positively charged dense central core. This
core is called the nucleus of the atom. Protons and electrons are situated inside
and out side this nucleus respectively. Since, compared to the whole mass of
the atom, the mass of electron is zero, so protons and neutrons imside the

nucleus determines the whole mass and positive charges of the atom.
b. The Nucleus is very small and most of the space inside an atom is void.

c, Electrons in an atom always move round the nucleus in different orbits like
the planets revolve round the sun in the solar system. The number of electrons
in an atom is same as the number of protons. Since the charge of an electron and

proton in an atom are equal and opposite, therefore the overall charge of an atom

is zero.

d. The electrons with negative charge are Electron
attracted to the positively charged ‘Mncclene
nucleus. The force of this attraction

is centripetal and due to this centripetal = ss Orbit
force, electrons move round the nucleus

like our earth does a round the sun. Fig 3.01: Rutherford’s Atomic Model.

Rutherford’s model is known as the solar system model for its continuous
parallelism to the solar system. Again, since the Rutherford model first gave the

idea of a nucleus, tt is also called the nuclear model.

20235
2025

Structure of Matter 43
Limitations of Rutherford’s Model

Rutherford is the first scientist to introduce the idea of a nucleus and orbits of an
electron. Although his model is the first acceptable atomic model, it has some
limitations. They are:

a. Rutherford’s model did not give any idea about the size and shape of the orbits

along which the electrons move.

b. Planets in the solar system are electrically neutral but electrons and nucleus
are charged, A parallelism between some charge neutral elements and charged

elements is not quite correct.

smaller. At a stage, itis supposed to fall into the nucleus. That will be the end of
the atom or at least its stability will be in trouble. However, that doesn’t happen
in nature; in other words, according to Maxwell's theory, Rutherford’s atomic

model is not correct.

3.6.2 Bohr’s Atomic Model

Scientist Neils Bohr gave some corrections to Rutherford’s atomic model in
1913, This corrected model is called the Bohr’s atomic model. The main
postulates of this model are:

a. The electron moves around the nucleus in a circular motion, about an axis.
This circular motion is called an energy level or orbit. They are also known as
44 Chemistry

shell or permanent orbit or principal energy level. Electrons do not absorb or
emit any energy when they revolve round these fixed orbits. If we express the
permanent orbit as n, then n= 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. In other words, ifn = 1, the principal
energy level is K, when n = 2, L is the principal energy level, when n= 3, M is
ithe principal energy level, when n= 4, N is the principal energy level ete,

b. According to Bohr’s model, the angular momentum of an electron in an
energy level is mvr = nh/2z . Here,

m = the mass of electron ( 9.11*107! ke)

T= the radius of the orbit that the electron follows

v = the velocity of electron in the permanent orbit

h= Plank constant (h = 6.62610 m* kg’s)

n= principal energy level or principal quantum number (n= 1, 2, 3, 4,

.)

According to this. the energy level with a lesser value of nis the lower energy
level and the energy level with a higher value of n is the higher energy level.

Fig 3.03: Bohr’s Atomie Model.

When an electron moves a round in its principal energy level, it doesn’t absorb
or emit any energy. However, it absorbs energy when it moves from a lower to a
higher energy level. The same way, an electron emits energy when it moves from

a higher to a lower energy level. This absorbed or emitted energy is hv = he/A. a

v= frequency of absorbed or ennitted energy (unit s' or Hz)
A= length of energy wave absorbed or emitted (unit m)

The light emitted when an electron moves from higher energy level to lower
energy level creates an atomic spectra when it goes through a prism.
Success of Bohr’s Model

a. Rutherford compared the orbits of electrons around nucleus to that of the
planets in the solar system. It did not mention anything about the size of the
energy levels. Bohr’s atomic model specifies the circular size of the energy
levels.

b. Rutherford’s model does not mention about the changes in structure of atom
when they absorb or emit energy. The Bohr model states that the electron moves
from lower to upper energy level when the atom absorbs energy and it moves
from upper to lower energy level when the atom emits energy.

c. The Rutherford model doesn’t explain the atomic spectra but the Bohr model
can explain the atomic spectra of hydrogen (H) atom with one electron.

Limitations of Bohr’s Model

a. Although the Bohr model can explain the spectrum of hydrogen containing
one electron, it cannot explain the spectrum of ions or atoms contamimg more
than one electron.

b. When electrons are transferred from one energy level to another.
according to Bohr, there will be a single line in the spectrum. But highly
sensitive apparatus shows every line consists of several fine lines. Why each line
is the summation of various lines is not explained.

c. The Bohr model specifies that orbits of electrons in an atom is circular.
However, later on, it was proved that the orbits can be of oval shape too.

3.7 Orbital Electronic Configuration of Atoms

The Bohr model states about the principal energy level. Each principal energy
level can contain 2n? electrons at the highest, where n = 1, 2, 3 etc. According to
this formula:
AG Chemistry

For energy level K, n = 1, so, the highest number of electrons in K is 2n? = (2x
17) =2.

For energy level L, n = 2, so, the highest number of electrons in L is 2n? = (2 x
2) =8.

For energy level M, n = 3, so, the highest number of electrons in M is 2n* = (2x
37) = 18.

For energy level N. n = 1, so, the highest number of electrons in N is 2n’ = (2x
4?) = 32.

Structure of Matter 47

The atomic number of Hydrogen is 1, meaning it has one electron which will

reside in energy level R. ‘The atomic number of helium (He) is 2. So, its electron
number is also 2 and these two electrons will enter the first energy level known as the
K-shell. The atomic number of lithium (Li) is 3. So, its electron number is also 3, and
the first 2 of the 3 electrons will enter the K-shell. Since the principal energy level,
K-shell cannot contain more than two electrons, its third electron will enter the second
energy, L-shell.

In the same way, the atomic number of sodium (Na) is 11. So, its electron number is
also 11. These electrons are arranged in the energy levels as follows: 2 electrons in the
K shell, 8 in the L shell, and the remaining 1 electron in the M shell.

A careful look will tell you that the electronic configuration from Hydrogen to
Argon follows the rule stated above. However it doesn’t remaim the same in the
case with elements from Potassium (K) onwards. We know that the highest
capacity of the third principal energy level (M) is 18. But the 19* electron of
Potassium and 19" and 20" electrons of Calcium enter the fourth principal
energy level (N) even betore fulfilling the third. In the case with Scandium (Sc),
the 21st electron has returned to the third principal energy level after its 19" and
20™ went to the fourth principal level. Beginning from the atomic number 19
onwards, bwo electrons enter the fourth level first and then the rest return to level
three. Still, we find exception in the case with Cr and Cu. We need to understand
the idea of sublevels of energy before we attempt to understand it.

3.7.1 Concept of Energy Sublevel

We have seen all energy levels are specified with n. These levels are again
divided into sublevels which are expressed by |. The value of | is from 0 to n-1.
These sublevels are called orbitals. They are identified with s, p, d, f etc.. The
value of / for different orbitals is shown below:

When n= 1, /=0. There will be one orbital: 1s.

When n= 2. /=0, 1. There will be two orbitals: 2s, 2p.

When n= 3, /=0, 1, 2. There will be three orbitals: 3s, 3p, 3d.

When n=4, /= 0, 1,2, 3. There will be four orbitals: 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f.
When n= 5, /=0,1, 2, 3, 4. There will be five orbitals, However, if all the

electrons are configured in the 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f orbitals, then there won't be any
necessity for the fifth. The same is the case with n = 6, 7, and 8.
48

Chemistry

The number of subshells in each prmcipal energy level is calculated by the formula (2/

+ 1). Each subshell has an electron-carrying capacity of 2. Thus,éaeh orbital contains

2(21 + 1) number of electrons. We already know each principal energy level
has 2n* number of electrons. Now we shall see that the summation of all

orbitals turn into this 2n*:

3.7.2. The Principles of Electronic Configuration in Atoms

there are three principles for electron arrangement in atoms: (1) Pauli’s Exclusion Prin-
ciple, (2) Aufbau Principle, and (3) Hund’s Rule. You will find a detailed discussion of
these principles in the higher secondary chemistry textbook. Here, we have provided a
brief overview of these principles to explain electron configuration in an atom. Here the

basic concepts of these principles and the electron arrangement of atoms are briefly
discussed, Electron first enters the lowest energy orbital of an atom and then gradually

goes into the highest energy orbital. That means, the electron will enter the lowest
energy level first and the highest level later. The energy level of the orbital is
determined by the summation of value of principal energy level (n) and value of
energy sublevel (/). The orbital that has a lesser value of (n + I) is of lesser
energy level and it gets the first entry of an electron. The orbital that has ahigher &
value of (n+ 1) is of higher energy level and it gets the later entry of an electron. ”
Structure of Matter 49

For 3d orbital, n = 3 and |= 2, so the value (n + 1) becomes (3 + 2 = 5), Again,
for 4s,n=4 and 1=0, so the value (n+ 1) becomes (4+ 06 =4). It shows 4s orbital
has lower energy than 3d orbital, Therefore, the electron will first enter 4s and
then will go to 3d. Again, if the value (n + I) of two orbitals are equal, then the
orbital with lesser value of n has lower enerzy and the electron will enter here
first. In the same way, the orbital with higher n gets the electron later for bemg
higher in energy.

For example, the values (ntl) of 3d and 4p are 3+2 = 5 and 4+1 = 5
respectively. Here in this case, since the value of n in orbital 3d is lesser than
orbital 4p, so it is lower in energy and orbital 4p, being higher energetically will
get electrons later. According to this system, the gradual sequence of energy of
orbital in receiving electrons will be:

ls <= 2s < 2p < 38 < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s =< 4d <5p
«6s = 4f = 5d < 6p = 7s =< 5f < 6d =< 7p = 8s

We can easily remember the sequence
of energy level from the chart below:

We have seen, the orbital s can contain a oe
maximum of two electrons, the orbital p

\y

can contain a maximum of six electrons,
the orbital d can contain a maximum of
ten electrons and the orbital f can
contain a maximum of fourteen
electrons. Following this, we can
configure the electrons of the following Fig 3.04: Sequence of Energy of Orbitals.

Forma-7, Chenstry Class-9-10
50 Chemistry
Since the 4s orbital is lower in energy than the 3d orbital, so the 19th electron of
Potassium enters 4s instead of 3d. Again, in the case with Scandium, 19" and 20"
electrons go inside 4s and then the 21st electron goes to the higher energy 3d
orbital.

Always remember, when writing the electronic configuration, write down all

orbitals of an energy level side by side; otherwise there is chance of making

mistakes. For example: the configuration of Fe (26) will be
n=1 n=2 n=3 n=4

Fe(26)> | 18° 2s? 2p® | 3s? 3p dé | 4s?

Fe(26)— 1s? 2s’ 2p°3s* 3p® 3d° 4s?

3.7.3 Some Exceptions in Electronic Configuration

Commonly, if the orbital of the energy sublevel p and d are half full (p’, &) or
complete (p*, d'), that kind of electronic configuration is the most stable. That
way, the electronic configuration of Cr(24) is supposed to be Cr(24) —  1s?2s?
2p* 3s? 3p* 3d* 4s? . But the interest of 3d to be half full brings one electron from
4s. That way, the final configuration stands at Cr(24) 1s? 2s? 2p* 3s? 3p® 3d? 4s!

Do Yourself
The electronic configuration of Cu(29) is Cu(29) 1s? 2s? 2p*3s?3p*3d!°4s!
whereas it is supposed to be |s*2s*2p*3s?3p*3d*4s . Explain the reason.

3.8 Isotopes

Atoms of the same element with equal number of protons but different numbers
of neutrons and mass are called isotopes of each other. The three atoms in the
table below have the same number of protons. Therefore, they are isotopes of
each other. Hydrogen has seven isotopes ('H, 7H, *H, *H, °H, °H, *H). Three of
them are available in nature and the remaining four are laboratory made.

3.9 Atomic Mass or Relative Atomic Mass

We already know that, the mass number of an element's atom is the summation
of the number of protons and neutrons present in its nucleus. It certainly implies
the idea that the mass number is an integer. But you will see the atomic mass of
copper is 63.5 and the atomic mass of chlorine 35.5. How is that possible?
Indeed, it is the relative atomic mass. What is it and why is it necessary?

The mass of an atom of Fluorine is 3.16x10% g

The mass of an atom of Aluminium is 4.482x10™ g

It is really hard to use such small masses. That is why, 1/12 th of a Carbon 12
isotope is taken as a unit and then the atomic mass of other atoms are determined

relative to that.

1/12 th atomic mass of Carbon 12 isotope is 1.66 «107 g

Therefore, the relative mass of the element:

mass of one atom of element

> of mass of a Carbon 12 isotope

2025
32 Chemistry

If we know the actual mass of an atom, we can determine its relative atomic
mass. We have to divide the total real mass of an atom by 1.6610 ¢ to get the
relative atomic mass. Example:

The real mass of an Al atom is 4.482 x10 3g

4482 x 107748

So, the relative atomic mass of an Al atom is = —————_=-
Les x 10-348

=27

The relative atomic mass 1s a ratio of two masses, so it doesn’t have any unit.

3.9.1 Determining the Average Relative Mass of an Element from Pereentage
of Isotope
Most of the elements in nature have more than one isotope. We calculate the
average relative mass of those elements having more than one isotope from their
percentage of availability in nature. The steps in this calculation are:
Step 1: Multiply the mass numbers of all isotopes of that element with the
percentage of natura! availability of those isotopes.

Step 2: Get the summation of all the results of step 1.

Step 3: Divide the total of step 2 by 100. This will give the average
relative mass of that element,

Suppose, an element A has 2 isotopes. If the mass number and natural
availability of one of these isotopes are p and m respectively while the same of
the other are q and n, then,
pxm + qxn

100
Example: There are two isotopes of chlorine in nature,?Cl and “C1.

The average relative atomic mass of that element is =

Naturally available percentage of *Cl = 75%

Naturally available percentage of 7°C1=25%

: ‘ . 35X75 + 37X25
So, the average relative atomic mass of chlorine = ————————__ = 35.5

In the periodic table also, you will see that the average relative atomic mass 1s
shown as 35.5. The periodic table displays the average relative atomic mass.

Example: If there are two naturally available isotopes of an clement, then we
can calculate the percentage of those isotopes available in nature from the
average relative atomic mass.

Suppose, in nature “Cu is available in x% and Cu is available in (100- x) %

the average relative atomic mass of Copper = pA ie = 63.5

100

or x = 75%

Naturally available percentage of Cu = 75% and
Naturally available percentage of Cu = 25%

3.9.2 Getting the Relative Molecuhr Mass from Relative Atomic Mass

We can get the relative molecular mass of an atom by taking the summation of
the multiplied value of relative atomic mass of the atoms with their respective
number of atoms. Generally, relative atomic mass is considered as atomic mass
and relative molecular mass as molecular mass.

The atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) atom in a H, molecule is 1 and it has two
atoms, so the relative molecular mass of I, molecule is 1x2 = 2.

Similarly, in a H,80, molecule, the relative atomic mass of H is |] and number
of atoms are 2. The relative atomic mass of Sulfur is 32 and number of atom is
1. The relative atomic mass of Oxygen is 16 and number of atom is 4. Therefore,
the relative molecular mass of sulfuric acid will be 1x2 + 32x1 + 16x4=98.

3.10 Radioactive Isotopes and Their Uses

We have already learned about isotopes in this chapter. There are some isotopes
the nucleus of which spontaneously synthesize themselves and emit alpha (a),
beta (8) and gamma (y) rays.Isotopes of and element that emit radioactive rays
are called radioactive isotopes. So far, scientists have gathered information
more than 3000 isotopes. Some of them are natural and some are laboratory made.
The physics book for your class discusses about various isotopes and their
radioactivity in details. We will learn about their uses here.

Controlled use of radioactive isotopes has made many an impossibility possible.
Presently, such isotopes are used in medical science, agriculture, preservation of
food and seeds, electricity generation ete.

3.10.1. Medical Science
Medical science employs radioactive isotopes for various purposes.

Diagnoses

Wecan take pictures of a patient’s affected area using radioactive isotopes, Technetium-99
(*Tc) is injected inside the body in this system. When it gathers a particular isotope at

a certain place inside the body, the isotope emits gamma rays. The gamma ray

identification camera [rom outside can take the photo of that spot of the body. The

lifetime of this isotope is 6 hours. Since it loses its radioactivity within a short time, it

is sate,

Treating Diseases

Radioactive isotope was first used to cure thyroid cancer. The patient is made to drink
a solution of I], This isotope reaches the thyroid and emits beta rays which destroys
the affected cells. Iridium isotope is used to treat brain cancer. "Co isotope is used to
diagnose and treat tumors. The gamma rays emitted from this isotope destroys the
cancer aifected cell and tissue. *P isotope is used for treatment of leukemia.

3.10.2 Agriculture Sector

Nutrition of Crops

Sufficient fertilizers are required for nutrition of crops. The quantity of fertilizer
is an important issue. Excess fertilizer costs more than necessary. It is also
harmful for the environment. Again, less than necessary fertilizer won't be of
any help. Radioactive isotopes help to determine the amount of Nitrogen and
Phosphorus present in the soil. Plants absorb radioactive Nitrogen and
Phosphorus via its roots which is then transferred to different parts of its body.
Geiger Muller counters help to identify the presence of these isotopes and helps
to determine the presence of the two elements in soil. Then we can determine the

remedy too.

Getting Rid of Harmful Insects

Harmful insects are always a threat to a good crop. They not only lessen the
production of craps but also they introduce various harmful microbes to the
planis. We use insecticices to rid of these insects. These insecticides are harmful
for our body and environment as well. These insecticides also manage to kill
other insects that were of help for our crops. Insecticides enriched with
radioactive isotopes have helped us to determine the standard of use of
insecticides for a particular crop.

Development of Crops

Radioactive isotopes also play a significant role in developing hybrid varieties
by bringing genetic changes in the original crop.

3.10.3 Generation of Electricity

A huge amount of heat is found in fission reactions or by breaking some atoms
into smaller atoms. Driving this heat energy through generators, we can produce
electricity. We call such power plants, nuclear power plants. The fourth chapter
of your physics book discusses this in detail.

The government of Bangladesh is going to establish a nuclear power plant in
Rooppur of Pabna. It is hoped that the power plant will be able to produce
2400MW electricity.

3.10.4 Impact of Radioactive Isotope

It is true that radioactive isotopes are there for a good number of benefits. But
al the same time, they have the potential to harm us too. The alpha, beta and
gamma rays emitted from such isotopes can bring about genetic changes to cells
which may cause cancer. The atom bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki of
Japan during the WWII killed lacs of people. The Chernobyl accident of 1986 in
Russia has killed numerous people and has done harm to the adjacent
environment.
