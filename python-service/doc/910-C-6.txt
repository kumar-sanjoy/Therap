Concept of Mole and Chemical Counting

Chemistry basically deals with two kinds of analysis- qualitative analysis and
quantitative analysis. Identification of an element and its properties is qualitative
analysis whereas determining the amount of a substance is known as
quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis deals with calculations which
altogether are denoted by the term cheniical counting. These calculations usually
use mole as the unit to determine the amount of a substance. In this chapter, we
will discuss what is a mole, how to use moles in calculations, how to determine
ihe cubic measurements from moles etc.

6.1 Mole

The word mole is the unit of any chemical measurement. Suppose,

12 nos of O, = | dozen of 0,

100 nos of O, = 1 hundred of O,

1000 nos of O, = | thousand of O,
Similarly, 6.023 x 10?* nos O, = 1 mole O,

| mole atom contains 6.02« 10” atoms
1 mole molecule contains 6.02 x 10° molecules
1 mole ion contains 6.02x10" ions

Therefore, the number 6.0210? is used in the case with atoms, molecules and
ions etc. This number is called the Avogadro number.

The amount of a chemical substance that contains as many as the Avogadro
number (6.02x1077} of molecules, atoms or ions is called the mole of the
substance. For example, 12 grams of C contains 6.02x10" number of C atoms.

The expression of atomic mass of atoms and the molecular mass of molecules
into gram unit is called one mole of a chemical substance.

Therefore,
12 grams of C = | mole C atom,
Again, 18 grams of H,O contains 6.02x10% number of H,O molecules.
Therefore,
18 grams of H,O = 1 mole H,0.
The Process of Determining the Molecular Mass of a Molecule

The summation of atomic masses of all atoms that constitute a molecule denotes
the molecular mass of the molecule. Cl, molecule, for example, has two Cl

atoms.

Therefore, the molecular mass of Cl, = atomic mass of Clx 2 =2 x35.5=7]

One mole Cl, =71 g Cl.
112 Chemistry

A NaCl molecule has ] Na atom and 1 Cl atom. Therefore, the molecular mass
of NaCl = atomic mass of Na + atomic mass of Cl = 23 + 35.5 = 58.5

One mole of NaC] = 58.5 p NaCl

CuSO,.5H,O contains 01 Cu, 01 $8, 09 O and 10 H atoms. Therefore, the
molecular mass of CuSO,.5H,O = atomic mass of Cu x ] + atomic mass of

A mole of CuS0,5H,0 = 249.5 g CuS0,5H,0

Problem: What is the mass of | H,0 molecule?

Solution: We know. 1 mole H,O = 18 g H,O = 6,023x10% no of H,O

Here, the molecular mass of 6.02x10” H,O molecules = 18 g

_ 18 23
Therefore, the mass of | H,O molecule = ae 7 2.99 x 107*"8

Problem: How many H,SO, molecules are there in 1g H,SO,?

Solution: We know, 1 mole H,S0, = O98 g Iso = 6.023=107 no of H,S0 A

Here, 98 ¢g H,SO, = 6.023x10 no of H,SO, molecules
Therefore, the mass of 1g H,SO, = sozxie’ = 6.1410"! H,SO, molecules.

Problem: Calculate the mole of ILO present in 5g 11,0.

Solution: We know, | mole H,O = 18g H,0 = 6.023x107 no of H,0
molecules.

Here, 18 g H,O = 1 mole H,O

ig H,0 == mole H,0

Therefore, § g H,O =~" = 0.277 mole H,0.

6.1.1 Molar Volume of Gas

The volume that | mole of a gaseous substance occupies is called the molar
volume of that gas. 0°C temperature and | atm pressure together is called the
standard temperature and pressure or the standard condition. The volume of 1
mole gas in this standard condition is 22.4 liter.

6.1.2. Mole and Molecular Formula

There is a relation between mole and molecular formula. The quantity in gram
determined when we express the molecular mass of a substance gotten from its
molecular formula is called 1 mole of that substance. For example, molecular
formula of water is H,O and its molecular mass is 18. Therefore 18 gram is
called 1 gram molecular mass water or 1 mole water. It is clear here that, mole is
also the gram molecular mass.

Molecular formula provides some other information too. For example, in the
case with H,O:
I. H,0 is water.

Zi The formula of 1 molecule water is 1,0.

3. The formula of 1 mole water is H,O.

4.1 molecule H,O contains 2 hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom.

5. 1 mole H,O molecule contains 2 mole hydrogen and | mole oxygen

atoms.

6, In 1 mole H,O molecule, the mass of H atom is 1x2 = 2 g and the mass
of O atom is 16x1 =16 g. Therefore, the total mass of 1 mole H,O

molecule is 2+ 16=18 g,

7. In | mole HyO molecule, the number of H atoms are 6,023 x 10x 2
= 1.20 10% and the number of O atoms are 6.023 x 107%x |=
6.023 x10" and the number of HO molecules are 6.023 x 10”.

6.1.3. Molar Solution

Suppose a solute is dissolved in a solvent. At a fixed temperature, if one mole

solute is dissolved in | liter solution, then that solution is called molar solution

or | molar solution. If2 mole solute is dissolved in 1 mole solution, that solution

is called 2 molar solution.

An example can make us differentiale between solute, solvent and solution. Take
about half a glass of water. Add some edible salt to the water and mix it with a
spoon. You will see the salt is no more visible in the water, after a while. This
mix of salt and water is a solution. Here water is the solvent and salt is the solute.

Liquids such as water, acid, alcohol ete.
are necessary in preparing solutions. In
this chapter, chiefly we shall use water as
the solvent. When water is used as solvent
in a solution, the solution is called water
solution.

Solution = Solute + Solwent

You may come across the terms Dilute
Solution and Concentrated Solution
frequently. 10 gram salt mixed in 250 mL

SS

Fig 6.01: Dilute and concentrated solution.
116 Chemistry

water is a solution. Again, 15 gram salt in 250 gram water is also a solution. The
one with lesser amount of salt is a dilute solution while the other is a
concentrated solution. Again, 10 gram salt is mixed in two glasses containing
250 mL and 200 mL water each. The solution containing more water is a dilute
solution while the one with less water is a concentrated solution. Similarly in the
laboratory, smaller amounis of solute in a fixed amount of solvent creates a
dilute solution and greater amounts of solute in the same amount of solvent
creates a concentrated solution, Actually, there is no specific rule to determine
which is dilute and which is a concentrated solution .

The number of moles dissolved in every liter of solution at a certain temperature
is called the molarity of the solution. If 2 mole solute is dissolved in a one liter
solution at a fixed temperature, then the molarity of that solution is 2. When
there is 0.5 mole solute in 1 liter solution, that is a semi-molar solution and when
that same 1 liter solution has 0.1 mole solute, that is called a decimolar solution.
The molarity of a decimolar solution is 0.1 while 0.5 is the molarity of a
semimolar solution.

Preparation of Solutions with Different Molarity

There is necessity of preparing molar, semimolar and decimolar solutions in the
laboratory. It can be done easily following various steps. Firstly, you need to
select a volumetric flask. Secondly, you need to weigh the substance that you are
interested to prepare the solution of and put it in the flask. Thirdly, you need to
add some water and shake the flask to prepare the solution, Then, you need to fill
water to a certain mark in the flask. There is relationship in between molarity of
solution, volume of solution, mass and molecular mass of the solute.

Mass of solute in gram unit
molarity of solution x volume of solution in mililiter unit x molecular mass.

6.2 The Percentage Composition of Elements in Compounds

The gram measurement of an element present in a 100 gram compound is called
the percentage composition of that element. The molecular formula of a
compound is the source to determine the percentage composition of various
elements in the compound.

Percent composition of an element in a compound
atomic mass of element x number of atoms x 100

Example: The percent composition of H and Cl in HC! is shown below:

In 36.5 gram HC] the amount of H = | gram

‘ 1
In lgram HC] the amount of H = Jeg gram

1 100

In 100 gram HCI the amount of H = <n 2.74 gram

So, the percent composition of H in HCI is 2.74%.
Again,

In 36.5 gram HCI the amount of Cl = 35.5 gram

In lgram HCI the amount of Cl = as gram

35.5 «100

In 100 gram HC] the amount of Cl = SEE

= 97,26 gram
So, the percent composition of H in HCI is 97.26%.
It can also be calculated that the percent composition of Cl is (100-2.74) = 97.26%,

Problem: Find out the percent composition of H and O in H30.

6.2.1 Percent Composition and Empirical Formula

We are already familiar with the term Molecular Formula as we have learned
what it is and have applied it to determine the number of atoms of elements in a
molecule. The idea of an empirical formula has been introduced to express the
ratio of various atoms in a molecule. For example, there are two H atoms and
two O atoms in hydrogen peroxide (H,O,). Therefore, the ratio of the atoms in
this compound is 1:1. That means, the empirical formula of H,O, is HO. The
formula that shows the ratio of the number of atoms of different elements present
in a molecule is called the empirical formula. We can easily determine the
empirical formula of a compound if we know the percent composition of
elements in it and its relative atomic mass.

Determining of Empirical Formula from the Percent Composition
The steps required to determine the empirical formula from the percent
composition are described below:

Step 1: The percent composition of the elements is to be divided by its atomic
mass.

Step 2: Use the smallest quotient to divide the other quotients and then multiply

these new quotients with the common nearest number to turn them into integers.

Step 3: Apply these integers to the right of respective symbol of elements. That
forms the empirical formula.

Step 4: Do not write anything if the integer obtained is 1.

Suppose, in a compound, the percent compositions of carbon and hydrogen are
92.31% and 7.69% respectively.

First, let’s divide the percent compositions with their atomic masses.

= 2 +6
12
H= iy =7.69

Now divide the quotients with the smallest of quotients:

20235
2025

_ 7.69
H= 769 |

Now write these values alongside the symbols of the elements and that gives you

the empirical formula. Thus, the empirical formula of this compound is C,H, =

CH,

Problem: The percent composition of elements in a compound are given as
H=2.04%, S = 32.65% and O= 65.30%. Determine the empirical formula of the

Now, we'll divide the quotients by the small quotient above:

Now, we'll write the empirical formula of the compound: H,O, = H,O

An experiment showed that a compound consists of 3 gram carbon atom
and § gram oxygen atom. Determine the empirical formula of the
compound.

6.2.2: Determining the Molecular Formula of a Compound from Percent
Composition

If we want to determine the molecular formula of a compound from its percent
composition, we need to determine the empirical formula first. [f the total mass
of the empirical formula of that compound is equal to its molecular mass then
the empirical formula itself is also the molecular formula. But when the
empirical formula and molecular mass of the compound varies from each other,
then we need to find out how many times greater the molecular mass is from the
empirical formula.

If molecular mass is n times greater than the empirical formula, then

Molecular Formula = (Empirical Formula),

Molecular Mass of Compound
Mass of Empirical Formula

Suppose, percent composition of a compound is C = 92.31%, H = 7.69%. The
molecular mass of the compound is 78. Determine its molecular formula.

Here, n =

Now, we'll divide the quotients by the small quotient above:

_ 769 _
~~ 769
H=8=1
7.69
So, the empirical formula of the compound: C,H, =CH

Since the empirical formula is CH, the molecular formula will be (CH), =
C,H,

The mass of empirical formula of the compound stands = 12«1 + 1x1 = 13 and
its molecular mass = 78

molecular mass of compound — 78

Therefore n= - —=
mass of empirical formula 13

Thus, the molecular formula of the compound is CsH¢

Determining Molecular Formula from Empirical Formula

The molecular formula of a compound can be the base to determine Its
empirical formula. Suppose, we need to find the empirical formula of glucose
(CgH)20¢).

A glucose (CgH):0,) molecule consists of 06 C atoms, 12 H atoms and 06 O
atoms.

The ratio of atoms C:H: O=6:12:6=1:2:1

Therefore, the empirical formula of glucose is C}H;0, = CH,0

Sometimes, the empirical formula and molecular formula are similar, For
example, the molecular formula of water is HO, its empirical formula is H;0
too. Both the formulas for sulfuric acid is H,504.

Usually, the compounds, all the atoms of which can be divided by a certain
number, have different molecular and empirical formulas. The molecular
formula of benzene is C oH: Since the number of atoms here are divisible by 6,
therefore, its empirical formula will be C,H, = CH. Similarly, the molecular

formula of ethene is Cj * Therefore, its empirical formula is C iH, =C Fe

6.3 Chemical Reactions and Chemical Equations

Chemical Reactions

The change which causes a substance to get a new set of properties giving up its
own properties and features is called a the chemical change, The process that
brings the change is called a chemical reaction. Chemical equation is the short
expression of a chemical process by using symbols, formula and sign.

The substances that are used to begin a chemical reaction are called reactants.
The substance or substances with new properties that are formed at the end of the
reaction are called products.

There are some rules observed to write chemical equations in order to express
chemical reactions. The rules are:

1, In a chemical equation, the reactants are written on the left side and the
products are written on the right side: an equal (=) sign or an arrow (— ) mark is
placed in the middle.

2. The reactants and products are written by means of their symbols and
formulas. If there are more than one reactants and products, they are written with
plus sign.

3. The number of atoms of different elements on the left side and the number of
atoms of the same elements on the right side need to be equalized. This is called

balancing of the chemical equation.
2H, 4 0;> 2H30

2H4 + O2= 2H,0

4.Sometimes reactions are not balanced in the equations. In such cases, the
arrow mark is used instead of the equal sign.

Hy + Oz —_*+ H,0

5. Sometimes, the physical states of both reactants and products are also
mentioned in an equation. It is written on the right side of the element or
compound in first brackets ( ). If the physical state of the substance is a solid, we
write (s), if the state is liquid, we write (1), if gaseous, we write (g). When the

2025
2025

Concept of Mole and Chemical Counting 127

substance is in the form of an aqueous solution, we write (aq). In the above
reaction, the reactants are gases and the product is liquid water. So we write:

2H,(g) + O,(g) ——* 2H,0(1)
The main objective of a chemical equation is to express which elements have

participated in the reaction to form which product. That is why, it is not always
necessary to balance a chemical equation.

6. However, if an equation is to show how much heat has been produced or
absorbed in a reaction, it has to be balanced and the physical states of reactants
and products are to be written.

Solid substance carbon reacts with oxygen gas and produces carbon dioxide
(CO,) gas. The equation will be as shown below:

cls) + Og) | —\—. CO,(g)

Solid calcium carbonate reacts with aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid to
produce calcium chloride, gaseous carbon di oxide and liquid water.

CacO.(s) + HClaq) MM Cathlaq) + CO. (9) + H,0())

ealcium carbonate hydrochloric acid calcium chloride carbon dioxide
water

Some reactions are there that require heat to be applied. The heat is expressed
with a delta (A) sign above the arrow mark. For example, if heat is applied to
solid magnesium nitrate, it produces magnesium oxide, nitrogen dioxide gas and
oxygen gas.

2Mg(NOs).(s) —* _,. 2MgO(s) + 4NO,(g) + 0.{z)

6.3.1 Balancing Chemical Equations
Chemical reactions are briefly expressed through chemical equations. Though

reactants and products are different substances, they are composed of the same
elements. That is why the conservation of mass rule is followed, When both the
left and right sides of an equation has the same number of atoms of the same
elements, we call that a balanced equation. See the example below:

Mg + HCl » Mgcl+ Hy
128 Chemistry

It is true that we get magnesium chloride and hydrogen when magnesium and
hydrochloric acid react; therefore, the reaction is okay. However, the equation is
not balanced as the number of hydrogen and chlorine atoms on both sides are not
equal.

The Process of Balancing Equations

To make the number of atoms of different elements equal. the formula of
reactants and preducts are multiplied by suitable numbers (2, 3, 4.......). There
is no specific rule to balance equations, but some strategies are followed in this
regard. They are:

1. The equation is written using the correct formula of reactants and products.

2. If the reactants and products are compound substances, that is, if the atoms of
more than one element are present in the formula, balance the equation,
multiplying the reactants or products or both with the required numbers.

3. First the number of atoms present in the molecules of compound substances
are balanced, Then come the number of atoms of elements.

4. When the number of atoms of each and every element present in the reaction
on both the sides are equal, then the balancing of the equation is done.

Let us examine some examples in this regard.
Example 1
Mg + HCl ————* Megcl,+ H;

In the above reaction, the number of Cl atom in the compound HCI on the left is
one while in the compound MgCl, there are two Cl atoms. It is understood that
the number of Cl on both sides are not equal. The same way, on the lefi, there is
one H atom while on the right, there are two H atoms. H atoms are also not
balanced. Mg atom on both sides are equal as there is only one on each side.

First, let us balance the Cl atom. For this, letus multiply HCI on the left side with
2:

Concept of Mole and Chemical Counting 129

Mg + 2HC] ———> MgCl, + H,
Now, a brief check will tell us that all atoms of various elements present on both
the sides of the equation are equal. Therefore, the balancing of the equation is
done. When the balancing of the equation is done, it can be written with equal
(=) sign too.
Mg + 2HCI = MgCl, + H,

Example 2

Na,CO,+ HC] ———— Nacl + H,0 + co,
This is not a balanced equation as the left side has two Na while the right has
one. Therefore, we multiply NaCl with 2:

Na,CO, + Hcl eO-_? 2Nacl + H;0 + CO;

Still it is not balanced, Now the right has two Cl while the left has one Cl.
Multiply HCI on the left with 2:

Na,CO, + 2HC] ———» 2NaCl + H,0 + CO,

Now, number of atoms of every element on both sides are equal.

Na,CO, + ZHC! = 2Nacl+ H,O + CO,

Example 3
Aluminum oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid and produces aluminum chloride

and water.

To strike a balance of Al on both sides, let us multiply AICI, with 2
Al;O; a Hcl nl 2ANCl, + H,0

To balance the number of Cl, multiply HCI on the left with 6:

Al,0;+4 6Hcl ———* 2Alcl, + H,0

Forma-17, Chemistry Class-9-10
130 Chemistry

Still balance is lacking as the number of O on the left is 3 while on the right is 1.
There is a difference between the numbers of H too. So, let us multiply H,O with
3:

Al,O,+ 6HC] ———» 2aIcl, + 3H,0

Now, there is balance,
Al,0,+ 6HC] = 2AICL, + 3H,0

6.3.2 Mole and Chemical Equation

Certain amounts of a reactant reacts with a certain amount of another reactant
and produces a certain amount of product or products. The branch of chemistry
that deals with measurements of products from amounts of reactants and
measurements of reactants from amounts of products is called Stoichiometry.
The information that can be gathered regarding mole from a chemical equation
is the Stoichiometry of that reaction.

Analyzing the Stoichiometry, we can tell how many reactants reacted to produce
how many products, how many moles of reactants formed how many moles of
products, how many grams of reactants participated in the reaction to produce
how many grams of products.

2Mg(s) + fg) -— 2MgO(s)

According to stoichiometry, we can write

2Mg(s) + 0,(g) ———* 32Mg0(s)

These accounts presented below a balanced equation of a chemical reaction are
called tts Stoichiometry. When both reactants and products are gaseous
substances, in the Stoichiometry, under standard conditions, 1 mole gaseous
substance has the volume of 22.4 liter.

Problem: How much oxygen is necessary for 5 gram magnesium to react and
produce magnesium oxide completely?

Solution: Magnesium reacts with oxygen and produces magnesium oxide. The
balanced equation of this reaction along with its Stoichiometry is shown above.
Accordingly with this Stoichiometry:

48 gram magnesium reacts with 32 gram oxygen

| gram magnesium reacts with _ gtam oxygen

—— = 3.33 gram oxygen

Problem: How many grams of magnesium oxide will be produced if we put
the necessary amount of oxygen with 2 gram magnesium metal?

Solution: According to the Stoichiometry of the reaction:
48 gram Mg metal produces “ gram magnesium oxide

| gram Mg metal produces Se gram magnesium oxide

2 gram Mg metal produces st = 3.33 gram magnesium oxide

Problem: How much oxygen is necessary alongside the required amount of
magnesium metal to produce 10 gram magnesium oxide?

Solution: According to the Stoichiometry of the reaction:

80 gram magnesium oxide is produced from 32 pram oxygen

| gram magnesium oxide is produced from —— 7 gram oxygen

Task: How many moles of O, is necessary to produce 6 moles of water?

Task: How much NH, in liter will be formed out of 4 liter N, at standard
temperature and pressure? Here, both reactants and products are gaseous.

6.4 Limiting Reactant

If there is more than one reactant in a chemical reaction, itis not always possible
to supply all the reactants in the required amounts when supplied after weighing.
As a result, some reactants complete the reaction and none of it remains at the
end while another reactant was also there in the reaction but some residue of it
remains at the end. The reactant that finished itself during the reaction is called
the limiting reactant. In a chemical reaction, the limiting reactant is determined
by its amount. The amount of a limiting reactant will tell us how much of which

ot

a
2025

Concept of Mole and Chemical Counting 133

reactant wil! react in the reaction, how much residue will be left and how much
of which product will be produced.

Problem: 4 oxygen molecules are put into 4 atoms of magnesium metal. Which

is the limiting reactant here?
2Mg + O, —<—<—<$<—<— 2Mg0

2x6.023x10" no of atoms 6.023x10" no of molecules 2x6.023x10” no of molecules

Solution: The above equation tells us that, 1 O, molecule is necessary to react
with 2 metallic atoms of Mg. So, 2 O, molecules are necessary to complete the
reaction with the given 4 Mg atoms. That means, (4-2) = 2 molecules of oxygen
will be left over when all the given magnesium atoms will finish themselves in
the reaction. Here the magnesium atoms do not remain anymore at the end of the
reaction. Therefore, the magnesium is the limiting reactant in this reaction.

What would have happened if 30 molecules of oxygen were mixed with 70
aloms of magnesium metal?

Since one O, molecule reacts with 2 Mg atoms, 70 Mg atoms would require
(70+2)=35 O, molecules to finish themselves in the reaction. But the given
number of O, is only 30. Therefore, oxygen will finish itself in the reaction and
it is the limiting reactant here.

134 Chemistry

Problem: 75 g chlorine gas is mixed with 5 g hydrogen gas. Which is the
limiting reactant here? How much of which reactant will be left over at the end
of the reaction?

H, cl; os 2HCl

2 gram 2x35,5g=71 gram 2 x 36.5g = 73 gram

Solution: The equation of the reaction tells:

2 gram hydrogen gas needs 71 gram chlorine in the reaction

So, 5 gram hydrogen gas needs in the reaction “= 177.5 gram

chlorine

Since only 75 gram chlorine is given for the reaction, so Cl, will finish itself
earlier and it is the limiting reactant.

[ Task: Find out how rouch H, is left over in the above reaction. ]

6.5 Calculation of the Percentage of Yield

The reactants used in chemical reactions are not always found as 100% pure.The
purest chemical substances / reactants are called Analar or Analar grade
substance. Analar substances are 99% pure. The impure substances are purified
through crystallization, distillation, fractional distillation, chromatography etc
processes which you will learn about in higher classes.

Many a times, one or more purification process fails to yield 100% pure

products. When the reactant is not 100% pure, the reaction does not yield the
amount of product that was calculated from the amount of limiting reactant.

Concept of Mole and Chemical Counting 135

The amount of product from a chemical reaction, in percentage, can be
determined following the formula below:

Amount of Product Obtained from Reaction * 100
Calculated Amount of Product from Reaction

Percentage of yield =

Problem: 2 gram metallic magnesium reacts with the necessary amount of
oxygen to yield 3.25 gram magnesium oxide. What is the percentage of the
yield?

2Ma(s) + 0.({g) ——> _ 1Mg0(s)

2x 24=48 g 1x32=32g 2x 40=80¢8
Solution: According to the equation:
48 gram magnesium yields 80 gram MgO
So, 2 gram magnesium yields 235°. = 3.33 gram MgO

The actual yield after the reaction is 3.25 gram magnesium oxide.

Therefore, percentage of the yield = —_— = 97.6%

Task; When heat is applied to 80 grams of CaCO,, it yields 39 grams of CaO,
Determine the percentage of the yield. The atomic mass of Ca, C and O are
40, 12 and 16 respectively.

Name of Experiment: Preparation of 0.1 molar sodium carbonate
solution in a 250mL volumetric flask.

Principle : Sodium carbonate (Na,CO,) is a primary standard substance
because it is found in pure and dry state, it can be directly weighed on a
balance, its molar solution is long lasting. To prepare 0.1 molar sodium
carbonate solution in a volumetric flask, the following calculation is
necessary:

Here, V = 250mL, § = 0.1 molar, M = 23x2 + 12+ 16x3 = 106, w=?

If we weigh and put 2.65 grams of Na,CO, inside a volumetric flask and fill
the flask with 250mL water, the 0.1 molar sodium carbonate solution will be
prepared. However, this molar solution preparation is very tough as to
weigh 2.65 gram sodium carbonate is really tough. Therefore, the solution
is made at a nearer molarity.

Necessary Instruments: 250mL volumetric flask, funnel, weighing bottle,
chemical balance, wash bottle.

Chemicals: Pure sodium carbonate, water
Procedure

1. A funnel is inserted in the mouth of a clean 250mL volumetric flask.

2. A dry weighing bottle is weighed on the chemical balance. r.

3, Now, pour some sodium carbonate into the weighing bottle in a way so
that the total weight of the botile is 2.65gram higher than the previous
weight.

4, Pour the sodium carbonate from the weighing bottle inside the
volumetric flask through the funnel.

5. Pour the distilled water slowly from the wash bottle inside the volumetric
flask. After pouring half the water, fix a cork on the mouth of the
volumetric flask and shake it so that the sodium carbonate is dissolved fully
into the water. Now, add the rest of the water to fill up 250 mL.

( peiseninttin of percent composition of lattice water of nyavatea \
copper sulphate.

Principle: Blue vitriol’s chemical name is pentahydrate copper sulphate. Its
formula is CuSO,.5H,O. Blue vitriol consists of copper sulphate and 5
molecules of water. It is a blue colored crystal lattice. There are five moles
water in it. If heat is applied, that water vaporizes and its colour turns into
white. These five moles of water are called crystal water.

CuSO, .5H,0 ——— CuSO, + 5H,0
Ingredients: Copper sulphate, desiccators, chemical balance, ceramic
bowl, tripod stand, net, Bunsen burner/spirit lamp

Procedure

1. Weigh the porcelain bowl on Blue vitriol
the balance. Suppose, the weight
is a gram. Now take some copper
sulphate in the bowl and weigh it
again. Let’s say, the weight now is
b gram. Therefore, the mass of
copper sulphate is (b-a) gram.

2. Fix the net on a tripod stand and
put the bowl containing copper
sulphate on it. Heat it with a
Bunsen burner or spirit lamp.

3. Keep marking the copper sulphate as heat is applied. The blue colour will

gradually turn white. Since the water in the blue vitriol is vaporizing, it is
transforming its colour.

4, When the transformation of colour is complete, stop the heating.

5. Swifily take the bowl to the desiccators and weigh it again after cooling.
If it isn’t done fast, the copper sulphate will again absorb water and turn
blue. Let’s assume, this new weight is c.

That mean, after the vaporization of water, copper sulphate’s mass is (c-a)
gram. The mass of vaporized water from the blue vitriol is (b-a) — (e-a)
gram. = (b-c) gram

Calculation

Mass of removed water from (b-a) gram copper sulphate = (b-c) gram

So, mass of removed water from 100 gram copper sulphate = = x 100 gram

The percent composition of crystallized water in copper sulphate is * 100 %

Caution

The heating has to be slow and careful so that the heat reaches all the spots.
After the removal of water, the weighing has to be quick.

Task for Learners: Carry out a task to determine the percent composition
